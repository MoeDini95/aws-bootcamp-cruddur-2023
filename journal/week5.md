## Implement Schema Load Script 

Created a separate folder within `backend-flask` which will execute important actions to run for the local dynamodb.

Once you run the script in the terminal, you should be able to see the following output which indicates whether you created the table. 
<ing src= ./images/CreateTable1.png>

<br />


## Implement Seed Script 
Create a Seed sdk file within `ddb` and import the following code to be able to seed your data.

<br />

By running the file within the terminal it should output the following seed data.

<br />

## Implement Scan Script 
Create another file which will scan our data.

Once you run the script, it should populate data similar to this;

<br />

## Implement Pattern Scripts for Read and List Conversations
