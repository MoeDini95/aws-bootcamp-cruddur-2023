# Create an Admin User and Group within the AWS console

Created an admin user via the AWS console and provided it admin level permissions.

Later created a Group and added my user account. Created another account and noticed that the 'test-user' account inherited the permissions in the group which was nice.



# Create a Budget and Billing alarm

<img src= ./images/Budget.png>

Created a budget via the console to track Monthly spending as well as another one to track credits spent.

Created a Billing alarm through CloudWatch to monitor account charges.

Created an SNS topic to alert me on my Billing alarm via email.



# Generate AWS Credentials and install AWS CLI on Gitpod

 <img src= ./images/GitpodConfig.png>

 Adding this yaml config file installs the AWS CLI onto the Gitpod workspace upon startup.

Set the environment variables using 'export' followed by the AWS credentials. This essentially stores the variables into Gitpod.

Confirming on the gitpod site that the variables have been saved under User settings.


# Recreate a conceptual diagram for Cruddur
Recreated a conceptual diagram for Cruddur using Lucid. The purpose of this diagram is to communicate the architecture at a high level to its stakeholders.

# Recreate a logical diagram for Cruddur
Recreated the logical diagram for cruddur also using Lucid. This diagram is a detailed design of the architecture which outlines the tools needed to operate Cruddur.
